<H1> Amplify!!! </h1>

Welcome to Amplify, a song recommendation system that prioritizes and analyzes music based on Energy Levels.
This project showcases the practical application and performance comparison of two data structures:
a Max-Heap and a Red-Black Tree (RB Tree).

Energy Levels are measured between 0.0 (calm/less energetic) to 1.0 (fast-paced/highly energetic)

The application allows users to perform these action:
1. Add New Songs to the dataset
2. Retrieve Song Data (Energy Level)
3. Find Songs Based On Your Mood (Top N recommendation by energy range)
4. Compare Data Structure performance

<h2> Requirements </h2>

1. C++ Compiler (C++11 or newer)
2. SFML Library

<h3> Running Program </h3>
